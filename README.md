# Hi, I’m Pravar 👋

**Software Engineer** focused on **systems programming, backend development, and algorithmic problem solving**.

I build **reliable, maintainable software systems** — from low-level C++ utilities to production-style backend and monitoring platforms.

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy
> **Make It Work → Make It Reliable → Make It Smart**

I care about correctness first, observability next, and optimization where it matters.
