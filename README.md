# Hi, I’m Pravar 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer** with a strong interest in **systems programming, backend development, and algorithmic problem solving**.  
I enjoy building **reliable, maintainable software** — from low-level tools to analytical systems.

---

## Currently Working Upon
- Building systems-focused projects in C++ and Python
- Improving CoreZip with extended compression pipelines

---

## 🛠️ What I Work On

- **Systems & Backend Engineering** — C++, Python, REST APIs, SQL  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures** — correctness, performance, trade-offs  
- **Reliability & Debugging** — binary-safe I/O, validation, edge cases  
- **Interactive Engineering Tools** — turning complex logic into usable systems  

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **CoreZip — File & Folder Compression Tool (C++)**
A command-line, lossless compression tool built from scratch using **Huffman coding** and a **custom archive format**.

- Binary-safe file and folder compression  
- Bit-level encoding/decoding  
- Versioned archive headers & metadata  
- Compression ratio and performance metrics  

**Tech:** C++17, STL, Binary I/O, Algorithms

---

### **CritiCut — Network Resilience & Graph Optimization Platform**
An interactive graph-theoretic optimization system that identifies **structurally critical nodes** and weakens their influence using **effective resistance–based, constraint-preserving edge removal**, while guaranteeing network connectivity.

- Information centrality via Laplacian pseudo-inverse  
- Effective resistance from spectral graph theory  
- Safe edge removal with connectivity guarantees  
- Interactive visualization and audit logging  

**Tech:** Python, NetworkX, NumPy, SciPy, Streamlit

---

### **Sprint & Project Management System**
Backend APIs and SQL workflows for an internal sprint and project management tool, built in an Agile environment.

**Tech:** REST APIs, SQL, Agile

---

### **Pothole Detection & Geo-Mapping System**
A real-time computer vision pipeline that detects potholes from video input and maps detections to **GPS-tagged locations** for infrastructure monitoring.

**Tech:** Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow
